NAME
    Module::Cloud - Generates a tag cloud for modules used in given code

VERSION
    version 1.100860

SYNOPSIS
      use Module::Cloud;
      my @dirs = qw(foo bar baz);
      my $clouder = Module::Cloud->new(dir => \@dirs);
      my $cloud = $clouder->get_cloud;  # returns an HTML::TagCloud object
      print $cloud->html_and_css;

DESCRIPTION
    This class traverses the given directories, searches for perl code,
    extracts the modules used by this code and generates a HTML::TagCloud
    object that gives an impression of how often each module is used.

METHODS
  get_cloud
      my $cloud = $clouder->get_cloud;

    Traverses the directories set on the "dir" accessor and searches for
    files containing perl code. For each such file, the modules it uses are
    extracted. From this data a HTML::TagCloud object is created and
    returned. The more often a module is used the bigger it will appear in
    the tag cloud.
